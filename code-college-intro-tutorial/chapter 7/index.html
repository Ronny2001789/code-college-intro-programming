    <h1> <em>HANG MAN GAME</em> </h1>
    <p>Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase,
     or sentence and the other(s) tries to <strong>guess it by suggesting letters or numbers</strong> within a certain
      number of guesses. Originally a paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.</p>
